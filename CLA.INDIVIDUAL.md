## Intention Statement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ApplyEnv ("the Project"). This Contribution License Agreement and colocated intentions regarding sublicensing are intended to foster collaboration among contributors to the Project while hopefully ensuring your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

While this license outlines certain terms and conditions, we are open to discussion of its terms to ensure fairness and mutual benefit as well as protecting all involved from issues of potential liability.

As an "Open Source by Default" project, we value the diverse perspectives and contributions that each individual brings to the table. Contributors are encouraged to engage in constructive conversations, express their concerns, and propose solutions that align with the best interests of the project and its contributors.

Our goal is to cultivate an inclusive and collaborative environment where all voices are heard and considered. Together, we can shape the future of ApplyEnv and create meaningful outcomes.

### Intentions Regarding Sublicensing
1. Contributions: The Project agrees that any contributions made by you to the Project will by default be released under the terms of the license(s) applicable to the repository commit upon which the contribution is based.

2. Alteration of licensing: The Project reserves the right to license contributions as it sees fit and in the best interest of the Project, its contributors, and its users. Authority for doing so remains with the current maintainers of the Project. Changes to the public license do not revoke any rights conferred by a previous license.

3. Private Licensing: The Project reserves the right to privately license all contributions, separate from the license(s) applicable to the repository commits. By contributing to the Project, you acknowledge and agree to this possibility.

4. Royalties: In the event that royalties are received in direct relation to the privae licensing of the code of the Project, contributors may be entitled to a share. The distribution of royalties will be determined based on the following guidelines:

   a. The Project will establish a fair distribution policy for royalties, taking into consideration the significance and impact of each contribution.

   b. The specific percentage or share of royalties allocated to each contributor will be determined by the Project and documented in the distribution policy.

   c. Contributors who have made significant contributions to the Project will be given priority in the distribution of royalties.

5. Royalty Claims: If a contributor cannot be contacted or fails to respond within a reasonable time period (to be defined by the Project), they retain the right to request future royalties for their contributions. However, they will not have any claim to royalties received prior to the date of their claim.

Please note that this section describes intention only and is not legally binding. Additionally it is subject to change, and the Project may update or modify its terms at any time.

For any questions regarding this license, please contact the Project maintainers.

## Individual Contributor License Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Project.

Should any provision of this Agreement be held by a court to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
